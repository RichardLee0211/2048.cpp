the total goal: I need to got to demo stage

I could and try to add these features to to 2048.cpp in this hackthon
- [ ] class store and cold start feature
- [ ] Config file to config key bounding
- [ ] Roll back feature
- [ ] Database application??
- [ ] network leaderboard
- [ ]

the code design doc

something I need know more:
- [ ] chrono
- [ ]

```cpp
  std::minstd_rand re;
  std::uniform_int_distribution<> dist;
```

statistics.hpp would be what I need to transfer

how to do this?: in color.hpp, a wrapper on terminal coloring
```cpp
    std::cout<<red<<blue
    std::cout<<bold_on
    std::cout<<def
    std::cout << bold_on
                << "  Please enter your name to save this score: " << bold_off;
    endl(3);
```

code like this to draw the data structure
```cpp
    if (y == 0) {
      std::cout << "┌";
    } else {
      std::cout << "├";
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < (int)gameBoardPlaySize; i++) {
      std::cout << "──────";
      if (i < (int)gameBoardPlaySize - 1) {
        if (y == 0) {
          std::cout << "┬";
        } else {
          std::cout << "┼";
        }
      } else {
        if (y == 0) {
          std::cout << "┐";
        } else {
          std::cout << "┤";
        }
      }
    }
```

the biggest logic in game.cpp

TODO:
need to creat this own data if it doesn't exist

TODO:
I don't need to select game size

TODO:
it seems to be mess, game is generate in memu...

2048.cpp is the driver main function
game.cpp is the main logic
memu.cpp
scores.cpp for reading and writeing score
statistics.cpp for the top records

and there is onething I don't like, that's
using something.hpp to include everything needed in something.cpp.

in desing pattern, this should be one instance design pattern

statistics and scores are not well designed

this doesn't seem to be managable
```cpp
      std::cout << "  "
                   "┌─────┬────────────────────┬──────────┬──────┬───────┬─────"
                   "─────────┬──────────────┐";
      endl();
      std::cout << "  │ " << bold_on << "No." << bold_off << " │ " << bold_on
                << "Name" << bold_off << "               │ " << bold_on
                << "Score" << bold_off << "    │ " << bold_on << "Won?"
                << bold_off << " │ " << bold_on << "Moves" << bold_off << " │ "
                << bold_on << "Largest Tile" << bold_off << " │ " << bold_on
                << "Duration    " << bold_off << " │";
      endl();
      std::cout << "  "
                   "├─────┼────────────────────┼──────────┼──────┼───────┼─────"
                   "─────────┼──────────────┤";
      endl();
    }

    std::cout << "  │ " << std::setw(2) << size - i << ". │ " << playerName;
    padding(playerName);
    std::cout << " │ " << std::setw(8) << playerScore << " │ " << std::setw(4)
              << won << " │ " << std::setw(5) << moveCount << " │ "
              << std::setw(12) << largestTile << " │ " << std::setw(12)
              << secondsFormat(duration) << " │ ";
    endl();
```

this design...
```cpp
    void Game::saveStats() {
      Stats stats;
      stats.collectStatistics();
      stats.bestScore = stats.bestScore < score ? score : stats.bestScore;
      stats.gameCount++;
      stats.winCount = win ? stats.winCount + 1 : stats.winCount;
```

now, I don't wanna touch this code, leave his logic alone

not a nice solution, but got to make it work

TODO: need more checks??

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

got segmentation fault at the first time I run it

If I wanna diliver my software to customers, then I need to know a bit about windows

If I wanna build marware, then I need a public IP to host my backend

in a Hackthon, a idea that suit a category is more important than code itself

what if I wanna a program to run in the background automatically, imagine that I could use program in some macOS
how to self-copy and self-destroy programming

I could search each computer in this local network for each port
which port would usually litsening??

I looked not cool for stay up all night
a marware that take clipboard, screenprint, keystrock and so on

I need to compile project into executable files for quick hacking
